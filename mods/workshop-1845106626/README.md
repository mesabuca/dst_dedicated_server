# Smarter Ice Flingomatic

## Overview

This is a mod for the game of Don't Starve Together which is available in the Steam Workshop. 

Ice Flingomatic in the turned-off state will also detect the fire and put it off in 3 seconds and then automaticly turn off in 30 seconds.

BTW, Ice Flingomatic won't put off firepit, campfire, cold firepit, etc.

It's better if you combine the mod [Invincible Structures](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=503795626) with this.
