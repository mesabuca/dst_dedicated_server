Adds a backpack, amulet and compass slot to the game. Plus adds space for other mod's slots if you want it to.

I got permission from xVars (the original author) to do this because his mod made it a bit tough to resize the slots bar in your own mod. So instead of doing that I made an API Edition where you can configure the number of slots you want to add so EES chages the ui size instead of your mod!

Right now it's been made to work with my other mod but if you want the option to add more slots for your custom mod just comment here.

Options:
None - Plain old EES
1 - Adds space for a mod which adds 1 extra slot. E.g My Apothecary Medicamento or the Archery Mod by ZupaleX.
2 - Adds space for 2 extra slots. E.g Apothecary and Archery at the same time!
